        <p>Clothing policies in many countries have become commonplace. However, there is always something odd about every teacher being asked, the answer is &quot;So that there is no difference, all students are the same&quot;, but I think if they don&#39;t want to differentiate, stupid and smart people shouldn&#39;t be told the difference in their mental abilities. Or a ranking system, with that alone, there are already many differences that can be taken.</p>
<p>Then on other special occasions such as Isra Mi&#39;raj which allows custom clothes, all students have appropriate and colorful clothes, no one feels embarrassed or oppresses others. If the intention is not to differentiate, shouldn&#39;t there be anything different in an event like this?</p>
<p>There is also another reason that I think is a little more reasonable, namely so that they are trained to obey the rules from an early age. But my opinion is, things like this will not change students. The clothes are bought by the parents and the students just have to wear them. It is the parents who have to follow the rules. In every ceremony, what is definitely considered is the neatness and completeness of the attributes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if you really want your students to obey the rules, you can tighten up homework, or each student must have complete writing equipment. Because it is useless to have neat and complete clothes, but there are no writing equipment, I also often don&#39;t have my pen and I think &quot;this should be checked!&quot;. But of course it also depends on the students who want to be regulated or not.</p>
