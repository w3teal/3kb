        <p>When I wrote a <a href="https://dev.to/w3teal/i-moved-to-gitlab-idl">blog about my move to GitLab</a>, since then my coding activities began to fade. I know, GitHub could not be run at that time, because <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/l.birulangit.web.id/post/3lfrj7cgmic2e">now it can (I don&#39;t know why)</a>, I started using GitHub again. The biggest reason to use it is the ecosystem and popularity. My project on GitLab, almost never seen by people, there is no other place where I can get stars and opinions other than GitHub. I also created an account on Codeberg, it is a good Git provider, only the same as GitLab in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>So I have the end result, I have 3 git accounts, irregular, some are updated on GitHub or GitLab. While Codeberg is in the middle, so I started to avoid GitLab and use GitHub and Codeberg. The UI of both providers is the same, so I don&#39;t get confused when moving from place to place.</p>
<p>Currently the proprietary software I use are GitHub, Google (the whole ecosystem! Including YouTube), and Windows. Windows is an OS that is often annoying, including what I often experience now is problematic time synchronization (suddenly going backwards). The reason why I still use Windows is because my family doesn&#39;t understand about alternatives like Linux, another main reason is that Microsoft Office is not available on Linux (Although there are alternatives like LibreOffice...) When I have a personal PC, I will try to use Linux as my main OS. I also really enjoy trying Linux OSes on VMware, Linux Mint is the best!</p>
<p>In coding, I never spend anything, Git is hosted on GitHub, deployed using Vercel. Domain using free subdomain and is-a.dev, no other software I ever pay for! Even... Microsoft Office that I use is a (to put it politely, NOT PAID!) version, I use <a href="https://massgrave.dev/">massgrave</a> to activate it, and it is amazing.</p>
