        <p>I first discovered the “<a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100DaysToOffload</a>” activity <a href="https://www.kytta.dev/blog/enough/">on Kytta&#39;s website</a>. Since I discovered it, I have been very interested in making more posts. This post is not the first post in this activity, but the eighth. (Even though it lacks context, the post doesn&#39;t need to be serious, right?)</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the eighth post this year! (<a href="https://dev.to/t/gmxcss">GMX.css posts</a> don&#39;t count of course). Since I&#39;ve created a new website, my imagination and typing skills have started to deepen. And that&#39;s the reason why I want to enter this contest. (We are not entering this contest to fight each other, but to share information!)</p>
<p>So in the future, I will be increasing my posts. But this may be canceled, I often have a low mood because of my school. Almost all the posts I make here are translated using DeepL through <a href="https://dxtranslate.vercel.app/">DXTranslate</a> (and sometimes Google Translate), so if the English language is not natural. Apologies, I&#39;m not very good at English and my first language is Indonesian.</p>
<p>There is a lot I can take away from creating these blogs, I can improve my skills, and I no longer expect people to read my posts, so my posts feel personal. This is a good new era!</p>
