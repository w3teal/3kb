<p><em>Choosing an instance on Mastodon is hard, I really like Fosstodon because it has dev, web, and FOSS themes. Also this instance has been around for a long time (2018, I still don&#39;t know anything about programming), and still has updates until now. I appreciate the Invite-only decision to reduce and give wide space to developers who really want to. (Although the approval request is enough, but this can also train how to communicate according to each person&#39;s way).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never written such a long letter to get a Fosstodon invitation link, I have contacted Fosstodon emails but have not received a reply. So I searched for people who are fairly new to Fosstodon who have available contacts. And I finally got Fosstodon!</p>
<p id="intention">

<p>And also as my intention, I will use Fosstodon as my only primary account (meaning the other accounts will be second... third...), so that there are enough accounts that I can leave, and I can focus on only posting on Fosstodon. üôè</p>
