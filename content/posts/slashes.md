Slashes pages like about, now, and uses are the most popular slashes pages, almost every manifesto has a listing. But what are the advantages of using slashes pages?

You can share specific information easily, like if someone asks "What do you use..." just put "/uses"! "Where do you live now..." put "/now"! It's very flexible and easy to remember. Also, there is no specific way to write based on the manifesto: You can make a list or long text as you wish.

You can check out the slash-slash pages I made at [/slashes](/slashes). Have fun creating or getting inspired! And if you want more, search at [slashpages.net](https://slashpages.net)!
