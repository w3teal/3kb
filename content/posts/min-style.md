title: Minimize CSS styles, better to be text only

I can't stand websites that are resource-hungry just because of their CSS and JS. As [Kev Quirk once said](https://512kb.club/):

> The internet has become a **bloated mess**. Huge JavaScript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.

Design can be nice, but you should also consider how the site will be used: A blog doesn't need to have all the dependencies that a very large website does. Just look at the New York Times, a single home page can be [~14MB](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/e72734dc-2ecf-4c20-812e-2836de2905ee)! And almost 50% of [its resources are JS](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/e72734dc-2ecf-4c20-812e-2836de2905ee/network), like they care more about analytics and tracking than user experience. I really hate it when my browser has to process so many resources just to read, I'm an average PC user, and my PC has low specs!

So please, if you want to start a website, don't overload people's PCs, reduce your dependencies and focus on a fast and lightweight user experience. Also, there's a bonus to adding your website to clubs like the [512KB Club](https://512kb.club/). If you have a weblog, I recommend making it as text-only as possible, like [textonly.website](https://textonly.website/). The websites on that list are really fast, aren't they?
