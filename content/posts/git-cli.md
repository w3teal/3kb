I always feel no shame in calling myself a "Developer", while I don't even know how to use Git. I am a heavy GitHub user, and I always use GitHub Desktop to commit locally. Some people use the traditional way to use Git. I just wish it wasn't this hard. Often my account and GPG key are inconsistent, because I often experiment by myself with only a few guides. And now I have a problem with verification on GitHub! It's very difficult to adapt from GUI to CLI. If only the traditional way of emailing Git could be considered easy for beginners...

(I just posted a question on StackOverflow and [DEV.to](https://dev.to/w3teal/how-to-use-git-send-email-correctly-on-windows-what-is-the-recommended-email-to-use-i50) about an error I was having with [git-send-email](https://git-send-email.io/), those sites make it sound so easy..)
