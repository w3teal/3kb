Even though I'm (a bit) late in completing this challenge, it's better late than never. This question was originally submitted by Ava for the Bear Blog earlier this year, then rewritten by Quirk for non-Bear Blog users.

I originally found a post related to this on [Gabbot's blog](https://gabbott.dev/blog/bear-blog-questions-challenge), which was adapted from [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/blog/blog-questions-challenge), from [Brandon](https://brandons-journal.com/bear-blog-questions-challenge/), from [Jedda](https://notes.jeddacp.com/bear-blog-questions-challenge/), from **[Ava](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/)**, unfortunately I missed it a bit late. 

So, let me get started!

## ‚ùì The Questions

1. **Why did you start blogging in the first place?**  
I started blogging [in 2023 with Blogger](https://ligmatv.blogspot.com/), to write down long things that came up randomly, and because I wanted an easy link to where my information could be listed. At the time, I intended to blog at least once a week, but I also realized that I was blogging for nothing. I wrote it in Bahasa Indonesia, because I felt like no one outside my country would read it.

2. **What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?**  
_Uh, explorer?_ I don't use a platform like CMS to manage my blog anymore, I just trust valid Markdown files, and when it's done I just build. Push commit to GitHub Desktop, and Vercel deploys it immediately.

3. **Have you blogged on other platforms before?**  
Quite a lot! From blogger, to jekyll, to vitepress, to docsify, to 11ty, to astro, to zola, to metalsmith, and until I made my own. To see my review, there is the blog [My history in blogging (& coding) (Until i fell to Dev.to)](https://dev.to/w3teal/my-history-in-blogging-coding-until-i-falling-to-devto-24ac) and [I have rewritten this website](https://w3teal.is-a.dev/posts/rewrite-website/).

4. **How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?**  
VSCodium, from SSG code to post.

5. **When do you feel most inspired to write?**  
In school, shower, using PC

6. **Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?**  
When I want to write a blog, I just type it as long as possible and publish it. I don't like to keep ideas for too long.

7. **What's your favourite post on your blog?**  
Well, I hate them all.

8. **Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?**  
Maybe a redesign, if it's a matter of changing platforms, maybe if SSG weblog.js is (really) unusable, regarding new features, as long as there is [no-JS](https://no-js.club/).
