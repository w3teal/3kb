description: How this lightweight website is made.
---

- **Light DOM Element and No JS**: The result of creating this website does not produce JS scripts in it, so you can feel free without feeling tracked.
- **Lightweight**: I use semantic HTML, lightweight classes, and a little CSS spice!
- **Powered by [Weblog.js](https://github.com/w3teal/weblog.js)**: This is a CMS I built entirely with Node.js, the code is only about ~170 lines!
- **Hosted in Vercel**: Weblog.js enables deployment automation with Vercel because it's built solely with Node.js!
