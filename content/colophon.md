description: How this lightweight website is made.
---

This is just a brief discussion, you can see the entire history on the blog "[Introducing Weblog.js, my custom Node.js based SSG](/posts/introducing-weblogjs/)"

- **Light DOM Element and No JS**: The result of creating this website does not produce JS scripts in it, so you can feel free without feeling tracked.
- **Lightweight**: I use semantic HTML, lightweight classes, and a little CSS spice!
- **Powered by [Weblog.js](https://github.com/w3teal/weblog.js)**: This is a CMS I built entirely with Node.js, the code is only about ~150 lines!
- **Hosted in Vercel**: This website is served statically via the output folder.
